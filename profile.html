                <p>
                    Born in a poor Muslim family, Nazrul received religious education and worked as
                    a muezzin at a local mosque. He learned of poetry, drama, and literature while 
                    working with theatrical groups. After a stint in the British Indian Army, Nazrul 
                    established himself as a journalist in Kolkata (then Calcutta). He assailed the 
                    British Raj and preached revolution through his poetic works, such as "Bidrohi" 
                    ("The Rebel") and "Bhangar Gaan" ("The Song of Destruction"), as well as his publication 
                    "Dhumketu" ("The Comet"). While in prison, Nazrul wrote the "Rajbandir Jabanbandi" ("Deposition of 
                    a Political Prisoner"), intensifying his criticism of imperialism.
